        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is Faizah Muhammad. I was born in Long Island , New York but raised in Richmond , Virginia. I've
            always been creative and determined to get the things I want, and parents can't get you what you want all of
            the time so I'd have to work for it and get it myself, even from a young age I’d do this. I would color
            pictures and sell them. As I got older I would make magnets, cookies, bracelets , and necklaces or whatever
            I could think of and sell them around the neighborhood and to my parents' friends. All the practice of
            selling things and dealing with people I was getting over time, helped me with my “first job”. My mom has a
            business selling zucchini bread and we would go to vending fairs and markets to sell our product and I would
            be the one running the everything, setting up our stand, collecting money, giving change, explaining prices
            etc. My next job was working with my dad he owns a gym, is a personal trainer, and sells workout clothes. My
            role in all this is putting his and other trainers clients payment information in the new systems, also
            sorting folders, answering emails and packaging orders.
        </p>
        <p>Currently I am doing online school which includes college courses. These courses dont give letter grades but
            if it did I would be an A B student. One of my extracurricular activities is orchestra. I play the violin.
            I've been playing since I was 8 but because of Covid i've taken a break but I will be picking it back up.
            I've
            also been a part of the Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, in this sorority we had positions like president, vice
            president etc. I was the treasurer, my main responsibilities were coming up with fundrasiers, organizing
            them, also organizing the money we raised. Another opportunity I was given from this would be
            seeing girls older than me pursuing their career and talents which has inspired and influenced me in the
            best way.
        </p>
        <p>I plan to study law and or culinary in college. My reason for studying law is because one of my career
            options is to be a lawyer and I think I would be successful helping people in whatever type of law I decide
            to go into. My other college plan would be to go for culinary. I am very passionate about cooking and baking
            so being in a career that is something I am passionate about is something I see myself doing. My last career
            option that I have considered is to be an actress. This path I take would not involve college. I'm
            interested in this because I think it would be a fun lifestyle while still learning many new things and
            getting new experiences.</p>

        <p>After four to eight years of college, if I chose to go to school for law then eventually I would find a job
            as a lawyer
            but until then I'll get another job or if I chose culinary then I would try to find a job in an
            authentic restaurant to get more experience to
            start my own restaurant. I plan to live in an apartment with one roommate so i'm not alone and the cost will
            be split in half. If I somehow get successful with acting then I won't go to college and I would still live
            with a roommate.
        </p>
        <p>I work well as an
            individual and a team, I make a great addition to any team I'm added to. I show great
            leadership, management, and problem solving
            skills. I also enjoy working with customers, clients, and co-workers. </p>
